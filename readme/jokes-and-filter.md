# Jokes and filter

## How does it work?

There is a file with a database of jokes, and a file of words that should be filtered out.

In the application folder, you can find two text files: Jokes and Filter.

In the first file named Jokes, you can manually delete or add new jokes. _After adding or deleting jokes, please change the number of jokes manually at top of the page._

In the second file, you can add or delete words from the filter.
